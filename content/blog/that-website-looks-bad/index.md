# That website looks bad but ... Why?

I'll always remember a nice exercise that we used to do in class. Our teacher always insisted with the low quality of the designs that surround us on street. So much that we used to pick a random place Google Maps and never traveled more than three streets in find ugly logos and signage designs. The exercise consisted of explaining what were the reasons that made them look bad and proposing a redesign that would solve the problems that we encountered.

# That website looks bad but ... Why?

I'll always remember a nice exercise that we used to do in class. Our teacher always insisted with the low quality of the designs that surround us on street. So much that we used to pick a random place Google Maps and never traveled more than three streets in find ugly logos and signages designs. The exercise consisted of explaining what were the reasons that made them look bad and proposing a redesign to solve it.

A few days ago I finished reading [Design for Hackers](https://www.oreilly.com/library/view/design-for-hackers/9781119998952/)Design for Hackers by David Kadavy, an excellent book that exposes very clear conceptual frameworks for understanding and solving web design problems. And while I was reading it, I couldn't stop thinking about repeating the exercise we did in class, but this time applied to websites using the concepts from the book, so here we go! The principles of design and how to use them against you. A true story

I'll always remember a nice exercise that we used to do in class. Our teacher always insisted with the lower quality of designs that surround us on street. So much that we pick a random place at Google Maps and never had to travel more than three streets to find ugly logos and signages designs. The exercise consisted of explaining what were the reasons that made them look bad and proposing a redesign to solve it.

A few days ago I've finished reading [Design for Hackers](https://www.oreilly.com/library/view/design-for-hackers/9781119998952/) by David Kadavy, an excellent book that exposes clear conceptual frameworks for understanding and solving web design problems and while I was reading it, I couldn't stop thinking about repeating the exercise but applied to websites and using some concepts from the book, so here we go!

## Design principles and how to use them against you

It took me some work to find a good example of bad design, but after a few hours searching I end up with a website to start: [San Diego Performance European](https://sdpeuro.com). Please, take a look at it for a moment before we continue.



### A little about content

The design process begins the following questions:

1. What is the user looking for on the website?
2. What is this website meant to do?
3. Hola?

Many projects are carried out without having clear answers to these questions, and they lead to confusing and unpleasant user experiences. So... What is SDPE's goal with its website?

It is not a blog, or a billboard for promotions, or a virtual store. Apparently it is a corporate identity page, in which they tell what their company is about, and leave some contact methods. Therefore, we could say that the objectives of this website are:

1. That the company exists on the internet and, search engines
2. Communicate their corporative identity
3. Facilitate contact methods to potential clients
4. Capture customers and increase their sales

Now, what does a user who visits this website look for? Among many other thing, it could be:

1. Get to know the workshop
2. Search for offers
3. Easily contact with the workshop
4. Compare services with other workshops

The first thing we can say is that the site neglects both owner and user needs and goals. The fewer images that appear shows only cars out of frame. If we saw the images in isolation, it would be difficult to associate them with a workshop. There are no tools, workers, or anything to indicate that it is a workshop, rather they give the idea of being a private collection.

It gives flat and ambiguous message. Nor does it attract customers or increase its sales, there are no calls to action, integration with social networks or offers section. From user's perspective, we cannot get to know the workshop, its values, or its identity and we don't have access to offers or discounts. We are given traditional contact information (address and phone) so we do not have any modern way of contacting the workshop and we do not have relevant information to compare their services with others.

From content perspective, they have neglected practically all main intentions why this site is meant to exist. But this isn't enought to explain why this website looks bad. There's a lot to discuss related to it's design.

### Why does it look messy?

One of the first things that I think when I'm at this website is disorder. The principle of direction and dominance give us tools to understand what is happening:

> #### Dominance
>
> The principle of dominance creates visual interest in a composition by drawing
> the viewer’s eye to an important element in the composition. When an element
> is dominant in a composition, it is one of the first things your eye is drawn to.
> It acts almost like a magnet when you first lay eyes on the composition. It also
> acts as an anchor – you keep returning to it as you explore other parts of the
> composition.

> #### Direction
>
> The principle of direction helps guide the viewer’s eye throughout the
> composition and helps keep the viewer looking at the design piece. Direction
> can be established pretty explicitly through lines (and sometimes even arrows!),
> but sometimes more implicitly through shapes, shading, or even invisible
> alignment

Lack of proper structure and order make the eye to not understand where to start, or to find comfortable places to rest. Lets take the header for instance, it is built with three rows. The real menu is on the bottom row, which has the same height and the same font as the top one, but due to the choice of colors, it's in second order. I am sure that many users confused the blue row with the navigation menu more than once.

Another question we can ask is, why is the logo that size and is aligned that way? It's small sized and carried so far to the left edge that places it in a place of little relevance. What is the most important thing in the header? Judging from the design, the phrase "Serving San Diego Since 1996". The rest is a cluster of elements that are relegated to the background.

### Why does it feel hard to read?

Going through the pages I find tremendous monotony, specialy with text areas where it gets difficult to read. They are difficult to scan because like the rest of the web, they lack a clear hierarchy and structure that allows me to understand the most relevant information at a glance. However, the problem with text blocks also have to do with the texture that is generated between the margins, spacing and line height. The principles of similarity, rithm and texture will help us to understand this:

> ### Similarity
>
> Similarity means that various elements of a composition – their shape, color,
> line characteristics (smooth or jagged), or texture – are similar to one another.
> Similarity makes a composition compelling because, as your eye travels
> throughout that composition, it is constantly reminded of things that it has seen
> before within that same composition.

> ### Rhythm
>
> With similarity often comes rhythm. Rhythm is a bit more abstract than
> similarity is. Probably the first thing that you think about when you think
> about rhythm is music. Just as the repetition of a snare or kick drum at a
> consistent point in a measure of music, over and over again, creates a sense of
> rhythm in music, the repetition of a particular design element or characteristic
> throughout a composition create a sense of rhythm in design.

> ### Texture
>
> Texture is the visual indication that something has characteristics that would be
> palpable if you were able to touch them. For example, if something looks like
> sandstone – or actually is made of sandstone – then that is texture. Texture is
> related to similarity and rhythm in that if a shape is repeated enough times, and
> at a fi ne enough scale, it generally creates a texture. Texture keeps a composition
> interesting because it provides an opportunity for the principle of contrast (which
> I’ll talk about soon) and can create a sense of depth in foreground/background
> relationships.

Throughout the entire web, spacing is almost the same and specially with text, where line heights and margins practically don't change between titles and bodies. This creates a homogeneous texture that added to a monotonous rhythm generated by the repetition of little differentiated elements produces fatigue and discourages the user from reading.

### Why does it look so boring?

Finally, another problem that design presents throughout the entire web, is feeling of boredom. The principle of contrast allows us to explain why this happens:

> ### Contrast
>
> The principle of contrast causes certain parts of a composition to stand out
> more than others because of differences – or contrast – between elements.
> Things in a composition can contrast with one another in terms of size, color,
> value (lightness or darkness), texture, shape, line quality . . . just about any way
> imaginable. By using contrast you can create dominance, or create foreground/
> background relationships. Contrast can be used as a guiding principle
> throughout an entire design (like if something is entirely black and white), or it
> can be used sparingly in a design that is mostly homogeneous, for more impact.

On top off to the feeling of clutter is monotony due to the lack of contrasting elements what produces a this boredom feeling. In fact, we could explain all previous problems, as a total lack of contrast between the different visual elements of the website. The only contrasting part is the footer. In which the elements of the nav are repeated, and the contact methods and social networks are provided. However, instead of collaborating, it adds more problems. What is the point of bringing the user's attention to the footer? Its a clear example of design decisions going against content.

## In summary

Now we can start to explain why this website looks bad and more importantly, we have a conceptual framework to base our design decisions. The principles of design are an abstract guide, which compresses many years of experience on what works well and what does not and are an excellent tool to understand the why behind design.

But ... won't you propose a redesign?

Yes! but that will remain for the next post. I hope you find some idea interesting.

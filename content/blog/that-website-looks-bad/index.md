# That website looks bad but ... Why?

I'll always remember a nice exercise that we used to do in class. Our teacher always insisted with the low quality of the designs that surround us on street. So much that we used to pick a random place Google Maps and never traveled more than three streets in find ugly logos and signages designs. The exercise consisted of explaining what were the reasons that made them look bad and proposing a redesign to solve it.

A few days ago I finished reading [Design for Hackers](https://www.oreilly.com/library/view/design-for-hackers/9781119998952/) by David Kadavy, an excellent book that exposes very clear conceptual frameworks for understanding and solving web design problems and while I was reading it, I couldn't stop thinking about repeating the exercise we used to do, but applied to websites and using some concepts from the book, so here we go! 

## Design principles and how to use them against you

It took me some work to find a good example of bad design, but after a few hours searching I end up with a website to show you: [San Diego Performance European](https://sdpeuro.com). Please, take a look at it for a moment before we continue.

The first step in the website design process begins with solving the following questions:

1. What is the user looking for on the website?
3. What is this website meant to do?

Many projects are carried out without having clear answers to these questions, and they lead to confusing and unpleasant user experiences. So... What is SDPE's goal with its website?

It is not a blog, or a billboard for promotions, or a virtual store. Apparently it is a corporate identity page, in which they tell what their company is about, and leave some contact methods. Therefore, we could say that the objectives of this website are:

1. That the company exists on the internet and, search engines
2. Communicate corporation's identity
3. Facilitate contact methods to potential clients
4. Capture customers and increase your sales

Now, what does a user who visits this website look for? Among many other thing, it could be: 

1. Get to know the workshop
2. Search for offers
3. Easily contact with the workshop
4. Compare services with other workshops

The first thing we can say is that the site neglects both owner and user needs and goals. The few images that appear show only cars out of frame. If we saw the images in isolation, it would be difficult to associate them with a workshop. There are no tools, workers, or anything to indicate that it is a workshop, rather they give the idea of ​​a private collection of cars.

It doesn't communicate its corporate identity and it gives flat and ambiguous message. Nor does it attract customers or increase its sales, there are no calls to action, integration with social networks or offers section. From user's perspective, we cannot get to know the workshop, its values, or its identity. We also do not have access to offers or discounts. We are given traditional contact information (address and phone) so we do not have any modern way of contacting the workshop and we do not have relevant information to compare their services with others.

From content perspective, they have neglected practically all the objectives for which this site is meant to exist, but there is still more, because there are serious design errors. 

### Why does it look messy? 

One of the first things I think when entering the website is disorder. The principle of direction and dominance give us tools to understand what is happening:

> #### Dominance
> The principle of dominance creates visual interest in a composition by drawing
the viewer’s eye to an important element in the composition. When an element
is dominant in a composition, it is one of the first things your eye is drawn to.
It acts almost like a magnet when you first lay eyes on the composition. It also
acts as an anchor – you keep returning to it as you explore other parts of the
composition.

> #### Direction
> The principle of direction helps guide the viewer’s eye throughout the
composition and helps keep the viewer looking at the design piece. Direction
can be established pretty explicitly through lines (and sometimes even arrows!),
but sometimes more implicitly through shapes, shading, or even invisible
alignment 

Lack of proper structure and order make the eye to not understand where to start, or to find comfortable places to rest. If we look at the header we will see that it is built by three rows. The real menu is on the bottom row, which has the same height and the same font as the top one, but due to the choice of colors, it's in second order. I am sure that many users confused the blue row with the navigation menu more than once.

# That website looks bad but ... Why?

I'll always remember a nice exercise that we used to do in class. Our teacher always insisted with the low quality of the designs of small and medium enterprises in our region. So much so that we used to pick a place at random on Google Maps and never traveled more than three streets in street view to find lousy logo and signage designs. The exercise consisted of explaining what were the reasons that made them look bad and proposing a redesign that would solve the problems that we encountered.

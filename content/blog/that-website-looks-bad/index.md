# That website looks bad but ... Why?

I'll always remember a nice exercise that we used to do in class. Our teacher always insisted with the low quality of the designs that surround us on street. So much that we used to pick a random place Google Maps and never traveled more than three streets in find ugly logos and signages designs. The exercise consisted of explaining what were the reasons that made them look bad and proposing a redesign to solve it.

A few days ago I finished reading [Design for Hackers](https://www.oreilly.com/library/view/design-for-hackers/9781119998952/) by David Kadavy, an excellent book that exposes very clear conceptual frameworks for understanding and solving web design problems and while I was reading it, I couldn't stop thinking about repeating the exercise we used to do, but applied to websites and using some concepts from the book, so here we go! 

## Design principles and how to use them against you

It took me some work to find a good example of bad design, but after a few hours searching I end up with a website to show you: [San Diego Performance European](https://sdpeuro.com). Please, take a look at it for a moment before we continue.

The first step in the website design process begins with solving the following questions:

1. What is the user looking for on the website?
3. What is this website meant to do?

Many projects are carried out without having clear answers to these questions, and they lead to confusing and unpleasant user experiences. So... What is SDPE's goal with its website?

It is not a blog, or a billboard for promotions, or a virtual store. Apparently it is a corporate identity page, in which they tell what their company is about, and leave some contact methods. Therefore, we could say that the objectives of this website are:

1. That the company exists on the internet and, search engines
2. Communicate corporation's identity
3. Facilitate contact methods to potential clients
4. Capture customers and increase your sales

Now, what does a user who visits this website look for? Among many other thing, it could be: 

1. Get to know the workshop
2. Search for offers
3. Easily contact with the workshop
4. Compare services with other workshops

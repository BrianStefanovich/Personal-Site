## Principios de diseño

> ### Dominance
> The principle of dominance creates visual interest in a composition by drawing
the viewer’s eye to an important element in the composition. When an element
is dominant in a composition, it is one of the first things your eye is drawn to.
It acts almost like a magnet when you first lay eyes on the composition. It also
acts as an anchor – you keep returning to it as you explore other parts of the
composition.

> ### Similarity
> Similarity means that various elements of a composition – their shape, color,
line characteristics (smooth or jagged), or texture – are similar to one another.
Similarity makes a composition compelling because, as your eye travels
throughout that composition, it is constantly reminded of things that it has seen
before within that same composition.

> ### Rhythm
>With similarity often comes rhythm. Rhythm is a bit more abstract than
similarity is. Probably the fi rst thing that you think about when you think
about rhythm is music. Just as the repetition of a snare or kick drum at a
consistent point in a measure of music, over and over again, creates a sense of
rhythm in music, the repetition of a particular design element or characteristic
throughout a composition create a sense of rhythm in design.

> ### Texture
>Texture is the visual indication that something has characteristics that would be
palpable if you were able to touch them. For example, if something looks like
sandstone – or actually is made of sandstone – then that is texture. Texture is
related to similarity and rhythm in that if a shape is repeated enough times, and
at a fi ne enough scale, it generally creates a texture. Texture keeps a composition
interesting because it provides an opportunity for the principle of contrast (which
I’ll talk about soon) and can create a sense of depth in foreground/background
relationships.

## Principios de diseño

> ### Dominance
> The principle of dominance creates visual interest in a composition by drawing
the viewer’s eye to an important element in the composition. When an element
is dominant in a composition, it is one of the first things your eye is drawn to.
It acts almost like a magnet when you first lay eyes on the composition. It also
acts as an anchor – you keep returning to it as you explore other parts of the
composition.

> ### Similarity
> Similarity means that various elements of a composition – their shape, color,
line characteristics (smooth or jagged), or texture – are similar to one another.
Similarity makes a composition compelling because, as your eye travels
throughout that composition, it is constantly reminded of things that it has seen
before within that same composition.

## Un poco de historia

Siempre recordaré un simpatico ejercicio que soliamos hacer en clase de Diseño Grafico. Nuestro profesor nos insistía sobre la mala calidad general de los diseños de los pequeños y medianos emprendimientos en nuestra region. Tanto asi que solíamos elegir un lugar al azar en Google Maps y nunca recorríamos mas de tres calles en street view para toparnos con pesimos diseños de logotipos y cartelería. 

El ejercicio consistía en explicar cuales eran los motivos que hacia que se vieran, adoptando el tono y la identidad de lo que se podñia apreciar desde street view.

Hace unos días termine de leer [Design for Hackers](https://www.oreilly.com/library/view/design-for-hackers/9781119998952/) de David Kadavy, un excelente libro que expone marcos conceptuales muy claros para entender y resolver problemas de diseño web. Y mientras lo leía no podía parar de pensar en repetir el ejercicio que haciamos en clase, pero aplicado a websites. Asi que alla vamos!

## Principios de diseño

> ### Dominance
> The principle of dominance creates visual interest in a composition by drawing
the viewer’s eye to an important element in the composition. When an element
is dominant in a composition, it is one of the first things your eye is drawn to.
It acts almost like a magnet when you first lay eyes on the composition. It also
acts as an anchor – you keep returning to it as you explore other parts of the
composition.

> ### Similarity
> Similarity means that various elements of a composition – their shape, color,
line characteristics (smooth or jagged), or texture – are similar to one another.
Similarity makes a composition compelling because, as your eye travels
throughout that composition, it is constantly reminded of things that it has seen
before within that same composition.

> ### Rhythm
>With similarity often comes rhythm. Rhythm is a bit more abstract than
similarity is. Probably the fi rst thing that you think about when you think
about rhythm is music. Just as the repetition of a snare or kick drum at a
consistent point in a measure of music, over and over again, creates a sense of
rhythm in music, the repetition of a particular design element or characteristic
throughout a composition create a sense of rhythm in design.

> ### Texture
>Texture is the visual indication that something has characteristics that would be
palpable if you were able to touch them. For example, if something looks like
sandstone – or actually is made of sandstone – then that is texture. Texture is
related to similarity and rhythm in that if a shape is repeated enough times, and
at a fi ne enough scale, it generally creates a texture. Texture keeps a composition
interesting because it provides an opportunity for the principle of contrast (which
I’ll talk about soon) and can create a sense of depth in foreground/background
relationships.

> ### Direction
> The principle of direction helps guide the viewer’s eye throughout the
composition and helps keep the viewer looking at the design piece. Direction
can be established pretty explicitly through lines (and sometimes even arrows!),
but sometimes more implicitly through shapes, shading, or even invisible
alignment within the composition.

>### Contrast
>The principle of contrast causes certain parts of a composition to stand out
more than others because of differences – or contrast – between elements.
Things in a composition can contrast with one another in terms of size, color,
value (lightness or darkness), texture, shape, line quality . . . just about any way
imaginable. By using contrast you can create dominance, or create foreground/
background relationships. Contrast can be used as a guiding principle
throughout an entire design (like if something is entirely black and white), or it
can be used sparingly in a design that is mostly homogeneous, for more impact.
